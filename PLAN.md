# Todo List App Plan

## Vision
Create a simple yet functional Todo List application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively.

## Scope
- Users can add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
- Tasks are saved and persisted between app sessions.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional Todo List web application.
- Source code with a clear folder structure and component breakdown.
- Test cases covering all functionalities.

## Development Phases
1. Design Phase: Initialize the app, create PLAN.md and DESIGN.md, outline tasks for development and testing.
2. Development Phase: Implement the application using TDD, write tests, develop features, and commit changes.
3. Integration Testing Phase: Write integration tests, ensure all tests pass, update README.md, and commit final changes.

## Challenges
- Ensuring data persistence after the app is closed.
- Maintaining a clean and manageable codebase as the app scales.

## Strategy
- Use browser's local storage for data persistence.
- Follow TDD to ensure a bug-free and maintainable codebase.

## Team
- Product Owner: Outlines the project scope and ensures all deliverables are met.
- Programmer: Implements the application code and fixes any issues.
- Tester: Writes and executes tests, ensuring all features work as expected.
